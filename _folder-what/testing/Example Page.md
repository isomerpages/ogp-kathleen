<b>SPY MUSIC</b>
<br><br>
The music[^1] for <i>Five Ashore in Singapore</i> was composed by renowned French composer Antoine Duhamel, who had just begun his career by scoring French New Wave films by legendary directors Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. At the request of <i>Five Ashore</i>’s director Bernard Toublanc-Michel, he composed <i>Somewhere in Singapore</i> (also known as the Marines’ March – “La marche des Marines” in French) with lyrics by Jimmy Parramore.

Quite brazenly, the song was directly based on the melody of the now iconic <i>[Yellow Submarine](https://google.com)</i>, the Beatles’ number one hit in 1966. Indeed, Toublanc-Michel had asked his actors who played the five Marines to stride out of Clifford Pier with the Beatles’ song playing in their heads, so as to lend a certain rhythm to their swagger.

Other melodies with no lyrics composed by Duhamel include <i>Paradise Limited</i> for the club scene and <i>Thème de la drogue</i> (the drug theme) for the opium den scene. </span>
