American physician and naturalist Thomas Horsfield conducted natural history research in Southeast Asia when he was employed as a surgeon by the Dutch East India Company in Batavia (now Jakarta) in 1801. One of the mammals he described is the small-clawed otter shown here. These mammals are native to Singapore but are now rarely seen as a result of habitat loss, unlike the smooth-coated otters which have become prevalent in recent years. <i>Image reproduced from Horsfield, T.

The “super spy” craze peaked between 1966 and 1968 and included a few shot-in-Singapore films like *So Darling So Deadly* (1966),[[^1]]([^1]) *Suicide Mission to Singapore* (1966)[^2] and *Five Ashore in Singapore* (1967). Apart from rare mentions in articles or books,[^3] precious little has been written about these films, even though they all captured Singapore at a time of change in the first few months or years following its independence in 1965. Of these three films, the most outstanding is *Five Ashore in Singapore*.
